# NoteExpress
This is a notepad like to automatically save notes. A small project to understand how C# works and a good way to keep my notes when I forgot to save it after a $#%& reboot.

# What is so special about this
***Open All*** menu, in a single click, will open all notes in the folder ***/Documents/NoteExpress***.
> Note: That will open only files with the extention ***.txt***.
><br>Also in the preference to open all when start

***Focus All*** menu, will bring all notes instances in front of other windows.

***Search All*** menu, will search a word in all NoteExpress files saved.

***Delete+Exit*** menu, will destroy the file before exit the application. So be carefull if you open a text file with it.

***Options*** menu, will add Date-time.
> Note: Also in the preference when open a new note.

# Better title
Show the first 60 chars of letters detected

# Command Line
You can use command line also to open a file just like this :
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\NoteExpress\NoteExpress.exe "c:\my\path\to\a\file.txt"
```
Is this useful! I dont know but this command line exists lol. Maybe if someone asks, I'll try to make it callable from anywhere.
